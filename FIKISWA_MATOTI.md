My name is Fikiswa Matoti, and I am a proud resident of Cape Town, South Africa, where I have lived since 2004. I have a deep appreciation for teamwork and strategy, which is reflected in my love for baseball â€” a sport that fosters collaboration while remaining accessible and engaging.

Beyond sports, I enjoy the simplicity and nutritional benefits of fruit salads, a refreshing and vibrant dish that combines ease of preparation with a burst of flavour. 

Music also plays an essential role in my life, particularly jazz (https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oNuESTuF0&list=OLAK5uy_kvGFCtHeXXzATQ_IV2zFUb6zNx_BLlGL8) from the 1980s. The rich instrumentation and timeless melodies of that era resonate with me deeply.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in languages. IsiXhosa is my home language and I speak English as a second language. I possess basic proficiency in IsiZulu, allowing me to connect with diverse communities and engage in meaningful conversations.

As I continue my journey, I embrace opportunities for learning, cultural exploration, and personal growth, always seeking to expand my perspective and enrich my experiences.
